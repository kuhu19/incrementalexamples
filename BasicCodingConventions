Basic Coding conventions

--You must write a clear, concise comment at the top of every class telling what one object of the class represents, stores and manipulates.
--Also, you must write a comment for every method telling what that method does with th object and with its parameters.
--Choose identifiers that follow proper naming conventions and are clear to the user
--Proper indentation of the class for better readability
--Instance variables should be declared private to implement object-oriented planning
--Proper Testing should be done
--Do not write very long methods but unnecessary fragementation should also not be done
--Every class that you write must be in its own file.The name of the file will be the same as the name of the class with ".java" at the end of it.
